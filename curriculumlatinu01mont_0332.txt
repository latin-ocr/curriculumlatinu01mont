Although the great improvements in the Printing Art have
done so much to add to the appearance of Books, and also to
diminish the eost, yet the price still forms rather a serious item in
the expense os education. This is particularly the case in editions

saving the others from that speedy injury or destruction which
besals books in the daily transit between horne and school. They
