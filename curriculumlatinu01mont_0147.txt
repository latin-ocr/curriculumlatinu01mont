Although the great improvements in the Printing Art have
<lone so much to add ω the appearance os Books, and also to
diminish the eost, yet the price still forms rather a serious item in
the expense os education. This is particularly the case in editions
of the Greek and Latin Classics. There is no want os excellence in
many os these, but they are generally either so comprehensive or so
extended by annotations, that the price is an obstacle to those who,
entertaining enlarged views os the advantages os education, have not
means commensurate with their wishes. lt is, therefore, the inten—
tion of the Subscribers, to publish neat and correct editions of such
detached portions ol* thev Classic authors as are usually read in
Schools and Colleges. This plan has been tried in England, and has
been attended with marked success.

To those who are obliged to study economy in education, these
editions will be recommended by their cheapness, their accuracy, and
their being limited in their extent to that which is absolutely
necessarv.

To ⁹those, who either possess, or can afford to possess more
expensive editions, these little copies will be offered as a means os
saving the others from that speedy injury or destruction which
bet'als books in the daily transit between home and school. They
will be more portable and convenient, more sair and scholar—like in
the class-room—not open to the just and reasonable objection which
Tutors make to editions so charged with notes, that they almost
amount to a translation.

Some years ago, the Subscribers made the attempt to introduce

a uniform series of Books into the Common Schools of Canada.
Their design was heartily seconded by the Board os Education in
Ireland‚ who promptly and with the utmost liberality placed the
copyright of their valuable Text Books at their disposal. At a verv
⁸considerable expence of labour and money, the Subscribers, in a
shorter period than they anticipated, succeeded in introducing the
Books into almost every section of the Province. Since then the
indefatigable and intelligent Superintendent of Education in Canada
West, who, at an early period, expressed to the Subscribers his
t'avourable opinion of these Books, having himself obtained per—
mission to reprint them, delegated the right to other Booksellers in
Canada, by whom, and by the Subscribers under their original
grant from the Irish Board, the province is now abundantly snp-
plied with these excellent Books. ’
